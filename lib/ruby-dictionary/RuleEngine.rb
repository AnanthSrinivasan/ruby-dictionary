#read the input and put the events and minutes into an hash
#bucketize the events based on the minutes they hold
#identify number of tracks required (how many days)
#talks should be mapped based on 180 possible mins in morning
#and 240 possible mins in the afternoon with lunch in between
#keep subtracting the minutes and get the remaining minutes

• Each session contains multiple talks.
• Morning sessions begin at 9am and must finish by 12 noon, for lunch.
• Afternoon sessions begin at 1pm and must finish in time for the networking event.
• The networking event can start no earlier than 4:00 and no later than 5:00.
